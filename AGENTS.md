# Linkgo Agent Rules

- Build Linkgo feature-by-feature; keep the app runnable after every slice.
- Every feature needs types, schemas, a typed capability/data API, docs, and applicable tests. Add a migration only when storage changes; add a hook/UI when applicable.
- Follow `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` and `docs/architecture-boundaries.md`. Run `bun run check:architecture`; new exception identities require architecture review, and removals require pruning exact stale allowances.
- Keep agent/runtime code out of UI folders. Use `src/agent` for model/tool contracts and `src/workflows` for durable orchestration when those slices land.
- Store shared frontend infrastructure in `src/lib`; keep Tauri-only OS integration in `src-tauri`.
- LinkedIn publishing and commenting must stay human approval-gated.
- Rate-limit and safety defaults must be conservative until metrics prove quality.
- Avoid pre-creating future tables. Add each table in the feature migration that uses it.

## Polish

This project uses the `uimaxxxing` reference-image-to-UI methodology. The
agent contract lives at `C:/ggcoder-projects/uimaxxxing/AGENTS.md`. Per-project decisions
(material map, palette, fonts, off-limits, density config) live in
`.gg/style-pack.md` — **read it before every CSS turn**. Asset-lane details
live in `.gg/assets/manifest.json` and `.gg/assets/slots/<slot>.md` when
`/polish --assets` is used. Reference-conditioned component work lives in
`.gg/reference-ui/<id>/` when `/ref-ui` is used.

The methodology is **not** auto-loaded into this project. Before the first
UI, CSS, layout, motion, or visual-review turn of a session, read
`C:/ggcoder-projects/uimaxxxing/methodology/01-contract.md`, `02-protocol.md`, `03-eyes.md`,
and `07-voice.md`; they route to the on-demand shards and companions. Non-UI
work in this project needs none of it.

Read a topic file only when the work touches it (all under
`C:/ggcoder-projects/uimaxxxing/methodology/`; links inside the shards resolve there too):

- Animation, motion, scroll, transitions → `08-liveness.md` + `motion-craft.md`
  (named-but-vague effects: `effect-vocabulary.md`; native apps: `native-motion.md`)
- Phone, touch, viewport height, safe areas, translucency → `mobile-craft.md`
- Need a motion or expressive-effect exemplar → grep `C:/ggcoder-projects/uimaxxxing/library/` first
  (category index → per-source registry; exemplars, not approval; pass the
  library's conformance checklist before reuse)
- Installed UI library misbehaving, or a new library implied → `library-craft.md`
- Loading / empty / error states → `09-states.md` · hit targets → `10-affordance.md`
- Keyboard, ARIA, contrast → `12-a11y.md` · wording → `11-microcopy.md` · sound → `13-sound.md`
- Navigation, workflow, onboarding, recovery → `14-experience-coherence.md`
- Two plausible directions, no probe settles it → `comparison-preview.md`

**Run eyes with the full path and the no-install env, in the same call, always:**
bash `UIMAXXXING_EYES_NO_INSTALL=1 node "C:/ggcoder-projects/uimaxxxing/eyes/<probe>.mjs"`;
PowerShell `$env:UIMAXXXING_EYES_NO_INSTALL='1'; node "C:/ggcoder-projects/uimaxxxing/eyes/<probe>.mjs"`.
Each shell call starts fresh, so `node eyes/…` (shard shorthand), a
`$EYES_TOOL_ROOT`, or the env exported in an earlier call all fail here. Without
the env a probe may silently install Playwright. A missing-Playwright error means
say **not verified** and route to `/setup-polish` — never install.

### Images (ImageMagick-backed eyes)

Whenever a turn involves a reference image, mockup, or UI screenshot — inside
or outside `/polish` — use the eyes instead of eyeballing a raw `read`. The host
shrinks large images (~1568 px long edge) and cannot open `.jfif`.

- Decode first (always for `.jfif`/`.avif`):
  `UIMAXXXING_EYES_NO_INSTALL=1 node "C:/ggcoder-projects/uimaxxxing/eyes/visual.mjs" --reference <path>`, then `read` the PNG.
- Colours: `UIMAXXXING_EYES_NO_INSTALL=1 node "C:/ggcoder-projects/uimaxxxing/eyes/palette.mjs" <path>` — never guess hex.
- Fine detail (text, borders, icons): crop with
  `UIMAXXXING_EYES_NO_INSTALL=1 node "C:/ggcoder-projects/uimaxxxing/eyes/extract-region.mjs" <path> --coords W,H,X,Y`.
- Live vs reference: `UIMAXXXING_EYES_NO_INSTALL=1 node "C:/ggcoder-projects/uimaxxxing/eyes/visual.mjs" --compare <url> <ref>`
  and `UIMAXXXING_EYES_NO_INSTALL=1 node "C:/ggcoder-projects/uimaxxxing/eyes/drift.mjs" <live-png> <ref-png>`.
- Raw ImageMagick is `magick` (v7). Never call bare `convert` — on Windows it is
  the unrelated disk-conversion tool. If `magick` is missing, say so; do not
  claim visual verification.

### Polish command

The `/polish` slash-command at `.gg/commands/polish.md` is tuned to this
project — it knows the dev URL, cascade entry, component dir, and
verification floor for **linkgo**. Invoke it for:

- `/polish` — inspect one journey, recommend one improvement (or none), wait for approval.
- `/polish <component>` — scoped to one component.
- `/polish --ref <path>` — reference-image-driven (full 7-step protocol).
- `/polish --ref <path> --assets` — asset-lane audit for non-codeable art.
- `/polish --assets ingest` — register files dropped into `.gg/assets/inbox/`.
- `/polish --assets plan <slot>` — write component anatomy/build-spec for one slot.
- `/ref-ui --registry <url> --mode clone|adapt|remix` — ingest a registry reference.
- `/ref-ui --repo owner/name --component <name> --demo <url> --selector <css>` — source + rendered contract workflow for repo/live components.
- `/ref-ui --refs A=<url>#selector B=<url>#selector --mode remix --traits "..."` — capture one contract per label, gate each selected label, and aggregate the label gates.
- `/ref-ui --contract .gg/reference-ui/<id>/contract.json --verify <dev-url> --selector <css>` — re-run the reference gate.

For missing prerequisites or changed setup facts, read the existing
`C:/ggcoder-projects/uimaxxxing/commands/setup-polish.md` workflow internally: inspect, reuse,
propose missing preparation, approve consequential operations, configure, verify,
and resume the original request. Use its internal-continuation input branch: carry
the inspected project root and setup-relevant facts explicitly; retain the original
request separately for resumption, not as setup arguments. `/setup-polish` remains the explicit setup/refresh
shortcut; no mandatory command sequence. Discover supported host tools rather than
assuming `/setup-eyes` exists. Distinguish configured instructions from render verified
readiness. Setup does not authorize UI edits or adoption; curated refreshes require
a narrow approved diff. Cancellation preserves existing files.

### When to use the polish loop (automatically, without being asked)

Use the same `.gg/commands/polish.md` instructions for normal conversation;
no slash syntax or synthetic argument section is required. Classify by primary outcome
before triggers: blank or vague requests diagnose one bounded journey and recommend
one-or-zero changes; no app or style-pack writes before approval. An explanation-only
question stays inspection and explanation unless changes are requested. Narrow directed
work stays narrow. Reuse valid same-scope approval, including identical journey scope;
planning is not implementation approval. New scope and stricter specialist gates still
need approval. Pass original request, surface, constraints, approval scope, and expected
evidence internally; journey-plus-component work remains journey-led. Read canonical
`C:/ggcoder-projects/uimaxxxing/commands/ref-ui.md` for source-backed components and
`C:/ggcoder-projects/uimaxxxing/commands/asset.md` for ordinary scratch art using local recipes.
Read `C:/ggcoder-projects/uimaxxxing/commands/perf-ui.md` for explicit performance plans and
`C:/ggcoder-projects/uimaxxxing/commands/ingest-spec.md` for supplied-spec planning; neither authorizes
product code. Specialists return result, retained approval scope, artifacts, verification
evidence, and unresolved gates internally. No unrelated source search for asset recipes;
ordinary measured performance fixes requested as implementation stay scoped in polish.

Use installed probes with `UIMAXXXING_EYES_NO_INSTALL=1`, inspect scripts before
starting them, and verify the explicit local target serves the intended root. Missing
browser or target support is a capability gap, not permission to install or claim readiness.

Within those boundaries, reach for the polish instructions or underlying eyes when:

<!-- BEGIN: polish-triggers -->

- Any UI, CSS, layout, or visual change under `src/components/`, `src/pages/`, `src/features/*/components/`, or `src/index.css` — run the `/polish` verification floor.
- Buttons, form controls, menus, dialogs (Radix) — `affordance.mjs` + `a11y.mjs`.
- New or changed data surfaces (queue, drafts, approvals, calendar, metrics) — `states.mjs`.
- New or renamed token in `src/index.css` — `design-system.mjs`.
- Motion or transitions — `liveness.mjs` under the methodology `08-liveness.md` gate.
- Title bar / window frame changes — desktop lane (`bun run test:desktop`); warning, not block.

<!-- END: polish-triggers -->

### Reference UI

Use `/ref-ui` when the user asks to copy, clone, adapt, remix, install, or take
construction from a repo, registry URL, shadcn-compatible install command, live
demo, or component library. Do not freehand from memory when the source and
rendered contract tools can inspect it.

Required artifacts before fidelity claims: `.gg/reference-ui/<id>/source.json`,
`decision.md`, `contract.json` (unless explicitly degraded) or multi-ref remix
`contracts/<label>.json` files, and `gate.json`. For multi-ref remix, `gate.json`
aggregates `.gg/reference-ui/<id>/gates/<label>.json` for every selected label.
Ask before guessing mode
(`clone`/`adapt`/`remix`), selectors, variants, selected traits,
license/provenance approval, or new dependencies. If the gate is missing or
failing, say **not verified** and ask how to proceed. If the reference contains
a concrete silhouette (logo/icon/book/device/card stack or hardware shape),
`shape-drift.mjs` is mandatory in addition to pixel drift.

### Asset lane

Use `/polish --assets` when a reference contains product renders, logos,
textures, cutouts, 3D objects, or hardware-like interactive controls that
CSS/DOM cannot honestly recreate. Never paste a flat image for an
interactive control; decompose into component anatomy first, then record
source, licensing, dimensions, provenance, files, and verification in the
asset manifest.

### Cascade contract

The CSS cascade entry is **`src/index.css`**. Read it before adding any new
rule — its `@layer` / `@import` order decides which layer your declaration
belongs in.

### Where to add things

<!-- BEGIN: polish-where-to-add -->

| What you're adding     | Where it goes                                                                                |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| New component styling  | Tailwind utility classes in the markup; shared global rules in `src/index.css`               |
| New shared component   | `src/components/<component>.tsx` (primitives in `src/components/ui/`)                        |
| New feature component  | `src/features/<feature>/components/<component>.tsx`                                          |
| New design token       | `src/index.css` — `:root` / `.dark` variables plus the `@theme inline` mapping (Tailwind v4) |
| New material / texture | `src/index.css` (or a new imported file under `src/styles/`); cite provenance                |

<!-- END: polish-where-to-add -->

### Off-limits

<!-- BEGIN: polish-off-limits -->

- None settled yet — `.gg/style-pack.md` §6 is the source of truth once filled.
- Never remove or bypass the human approval gate on LinkedIn publishing or commenting.

<!-- END: polish-off-limits -->

### When NOT to invoke /polish

- Docs-only changes, comments, formatting.
- Refactors covered by tests with no visual surface touched.
- Dev server isn't up AND the task doesn't require runtime verification.

### Capability-gap escalation

If a polish pass needs a probe that doesn't exist, surface the tradeoff
inline (same protocol as `## Eyes` escalation). Don't guess at visual
fidelity — log a `wish` with `ggcoder eyes log wish "<gap>"` and either
build the probe or fall back with the user's approval.
